### What I learned

How to create a hamburger menu, styling the particular project was hard cus I've never written this much of css code and the styling is'nt something I've done before. I took me through youtube tutorials and e-books to understand what needed to be done.



### Continued development

I still need to understand the hamburger menu stuff cus it's still confusing and read to understand more on css styling.


### Useful resources

Youtube is a life saver
